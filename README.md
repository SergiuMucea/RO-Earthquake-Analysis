# Earthquake Activity in Romania

📊 A data-driven exploration of seismic activity in Romania, using historical data from 1677 to 2025.

> *This project is inspired by official data published by INFP (The National Institute for Research and Development in Earth Physics) and references peer-reviewed research from the Annals of the Academy of Romanian Scientists Series on Physics and Chemistry Sciences, Volume 8, Number 1/2023.*
